## OUTLINE

- Name (prompt)
- "Hello [name]. What a handsome wolf you are. You are walking along a road when your tummy starts rumbling. Up ahead you see 3 houses. Which do you visit?
  - Straw
    - Cute house. You can see a delicious piggy inside through the little window. What do you do?
      - [H]uff, puff and blow
        - How many times? (prompt #)
          - (>=1) : I mean, this was a piece of cake. Or, pork. You gobble up the little piggy. Delish. 
          - (>3) : Overkill much? You blow the house down, but you also hyperventilate. The piggy escapes. 
      - [K]nock politely on the door.
        - Interesting ploy. The piggy calls "who is it?" What is your reply?
          - [F]ib. "It's Red Riging Hood! I brought snacks from Grandmother's house!"
            - "That's not Red's voice!" cries the piggy. It scarpers out the back and escapes. Nice try.
          - [T]ell the Truth: "It' the big bad wolf, and I would like to eat you, please!"
            - Predictably, the piggy is not excited to see you. "Aaahhh!" It yells, as it runs out the back, and escapes. No dinner for you. 
          - [L]and-Shark.
            - "What?" the piggy says. It opens the door. You gobble it up. I cannot believe that worked. 
      - [W]ait until dark. 
        - You ring up you old pal Rumpelstiltskin, who works through the night spinning the straw into gold. By morning, you've completely forgotten about the piggy and instead use your new-found treasure to feast at the local BBQ joint. Win Win.



  - Sticks
      - Sturdy, but not quite up to Lincoln's log cabin standards. You can see a delicious piggy inside through the thin glass windows. What do you do?
      - [H]uff, puff and blow
        - How many times? (prompt #)
          - (<2) : You see it quiver, but it doesn't quite fall down. Meanwhile, all your huffing and puffing has alerted the piggy to your presense, and it escapes out the back. Drat.
          - (2<=n<=3) : Success! You easily extract the piggy from the kindling that was once its house, and gobble it up. Delish.
          - (>3) : Overkill, hyperventilate...
      - [K]nock politely on the door
        - Interesting ploy. The piggy angrily calls "who's there'?" What is your reply?
          - [F]ib. "Um, I'm just another little piggy, just like you!" you call. 
            - "Which one?" grumbles the piggy. Hmm.
              - [1]st little piggy, who went to market.
              - [2]nd little piggy, who stayed home.
              - [3]rd little piggy, who had roast beef.
                - (if response === 3) "Did you save me any roast beef?" [Y/N]
                  - [Y] The piggy greedily flings open the door. You waste no time gobbling it up. Yummy, but now you really want roast beef.
                  - [N] "Well then get off my lawn!" A frying pan is thrown from the window with surprising accuracy. You run away, tail literally between your legs. Better luck next time. 
              - [4]th little piggy, who had none.
              - [5]th little piggy, who went 'wee wee wee wee' all the way home.
              - (All others) "You liar! I'M that little piggy! You're the wolf, aren't you?" The piggy runs out the back an escapes. You're a terrible liar. 
          - [T]ell the Truth: "It' the big bad wolf, and I would like to eat you, please!"
            - The door is flung open, but you find yourself staring down the barrel of a rifle. What is this, Animal Farm?! "You have 5 seconds..." the piggy begins, but you don't wait around to find out what for. This did not go how you planned. Apparently no dinner for you. 
          - [L]and-Shark.
            - "That's an old reference," says the piggy. It escapes out the back before you have time to say "Candy gram." Bummer.       
      - [W]ait until dark
        - You hide until the sun goes down, when the piggy lights a merry fire in the fireplace before bed, without realizing that its house is literally made of kindling. Long story short, there's nothing better than a good roast pig. 
        
  - Brick
      - House?! This place is a goddamned castle! Still, you can see a delicious piggy inside through arched window. What do you do?
      - [H]uff, puff and blow
        - (<=3) Well, obviously nothing happens. And all the huffing and puffing has alerted the piggy. And his archers. Crap.
        - (>3) Hyperventilate AND do nothing. The piggy laughs at you from the gatehouse while the guards come to collect your sorry self. I'm sure you'll have a lovely future as a throw rug. 
      - [K]nock politely on the door.
        - Interesting ploy. "Who is it?" the piggy calls calmly. What is your reply?
          - [F]ib. "Castle inspector!" You call back. 
            - "Ha," the piggy laughs, not remotely convinced. "The castle inspector was alerady here LAST week. Good thing, too, otherwise I would never have gotten my catapault back into working condition! Wanna see?" That doesn't sound good...
          - [T]ell the Truth: "It's the big bad wolf, and I would like to eat you, please!"
            - "I appreciate your candor." Says the piggy as archers line up along the walls. "Tell you what: I have no interest in being eaten, and you have no interest in being a throw rug. Shall we negotiate a truce?" You weigh your options.  
          - [L]and-Shark.
            - "What?"
              - [P]lumber.
                - "I didn't order a plummer."
              - [F]lowers. ...Um, candy gram.
                - "No seriously, who is it?"
                  - [J]ehovah's Witness
                  - []


      - [W]ait until dark.
