    <p>I didn't have time to to make a good entry part for the backstory. Here is the general setting:</p>
    </br>
    <p>"Trisolaris is a terrestrial planet, similar to Earth in most respects. However, the Trisolaris system consists of three suns orbiting each other in random and unpredictable ways.

      This causes Trisolaris to be hurled from star to star during so-called Chaotic Eras, resulting in climate conditions that vary without rhyme or reason.
      
      There is no set day or year on Trisolaris, and the planet's temperature ranges from cold enough to freeze the air to hot enough to melt the ground. During rare Stable Eras, Trisolaris assumes a steady an comfortable orbit around one of its suns, but this never lasts.
      
      Eventually, the instability of Trisolaris' orbit will cause it to crash into one of its suns, destroying it and the Trisolaran race.
      
      Because of this, Trisolaris is incredibly hostile to life, and the Trisolarans are desperate to leave. They set their sights on Earth, a planet existing in a perpetual Stable Era."</p>
