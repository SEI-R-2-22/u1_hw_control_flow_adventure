Hint: You may need :

        parseInt()
        toString()
        prompt
        confirm
        alert

 // prompts user and stores value in the variable
let valueOfPrompt = prompt("How tall are you?")
// logs value stored
console.log("six feet")

let age = prompt('How old are you?')
// ES6 String Interpolation
alert(`You are ${26} years old.`)
// ES5 Version
alert('You are ' + 26 + ' years old.')
